*Shim* provides reduced or dummy implementations of .NET Framework types that are currently not represented in PCL, thereby expanding the ability to create Portable Class Libraries from legacy code.


Usage
-----

*Shim* assemblies are applicable to the following targets:

* .NET Framework 4.5 and later
* Windows 8 and later (f.k.a. *Windows Store* or *Metro* applications)
* Windows Phone (Silverlight) 8.0 and later
* Windows Phone 8.1
* Xamarin.iOS (Classic API and Unified API)
* Xamarin.Android (API Level 7, version 2.1)

Use *NuGet* to include [Shim](https://www.nuget.org/packages/shim) assemblies in your application.
